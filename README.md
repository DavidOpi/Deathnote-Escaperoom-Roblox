# Deathnote-Escaperoom-Roblox
## Concpet:
Developing a deathnote themed escape room, using multiple puzzles, an in game working computer, and brain busting obstacles to grab the deathnote. Based off a popluar anime,
you are a FBI agent. You enter into Light Yagami's room in hopes of finding the death note.
Right as you enter, Yagami's security system locks the door behind you, leaving you no other option but to find an alternate escape. You have limited time before Yagami comes back home, and he is not happy you're here.

## Motivation:
We had this idea of making a Roblox game for experience and projects to put on our plate. Maybe even some cash flow if we get popular. We were planning to make it in Roblox because our years were spent playing Roblox games. We had this planned for a while but never started due to lack of motivation and procrastination. When this assignment was dropped on us we took this as an opportunity to start our very delayed roblox game. This Idea was based on an escape room us three have done in the past about Deathnote. I hope this game turns out as well as we think üëç.
